python problem Solution

**Set Up Prerequisite**
-Click on the .ipynb file to see the complete details along with outputs during test. 
-Sample Json data has been used to parse. Add more records if dataset is huge into this json file.
-Set up Jupyter notebook in your local system to test and then download this .ipynb file to your local path. Change the json path inside this file

**Analysis & Solution Approach**

Processed json data using json python libraries.
-Stored them in lists and then distributed them in chunks of batches depend on the volume of data using method and for loop.
-Parsed them and calculated the BMI value and applied logic for risk identification.
-Used Beautiful Table to publish this data in Tabular format for Risk idetification.
-Used Numpy and Matplotlib to group the data and display them in Bar chat comparison. 

**Test**


Use Pytest libraries of Python to test this if required.
